## Mean-field theories of dynamos

Astrophysical fluids are typically ionized and turbulent,
leading to the expectation of randomly oriented magnetic fields rather than ordered ones that remain coherent over many turbulent eddy scales.
Ordered magnetic fields are usually stirred up by turbulence and are not expected to survive beyond several eddy turnover times.
However, prominent examples of such large-scale fields include the solar magnetic field, galactic fields, and those near supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies.
The primary goal of mean-field dynamo theorists is to understand the generation and evolution of these large-scale fields.

Crudely speaking, large-scale dynamos can be divided into two categories:
those live in a fluid possessing a net kinetic helicity, and those do not.
Kinetic helicity is a particular property of the fluid, meaning that on average, the fluid elements exhibit helical motions like roller coasters which make magnetic field lines twisted over the turbulence scale.
Being a source-free field (<font color="#808080">divergence-free</font>), the net twist of the magnetic fields has to remain zero (<font color="#808080">if no reconnection happens, in the ideal MHD limit</font>).
Hence large-scale fields have to respond and grow accordingly.

The helical dynamo is conventionally thought to be catastrophically suppressed when the magnetic Reynolds number is large, as the case in most astrophysical flows.
We tackled this problem with new simulations and analyzing ideas, to provide evidence that this may not be the case.

    Research Interests
  </h2>

  <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
  I am a researcher in theoretical and computational astrophysics,
  with a focus on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), plasma physics, and turbulence.
  My work centers on dynamo processes that drive the amplification and maintenance of magnetic fields in astrophysical plasmas.
  I study both fundamental mechanisms and astrophysical applications of dynamos through a combination of theoretical analysis and high-resolution numerical simulations.
  These efforts span a broad range of environments, including stellar convection zones, planetary atmospheres, and accretion disks around black holes.
  In recent years, I have become particularly interested in developing effective dynamo models within general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) simulations to enable self-consistent co-evolution of accretion flows and magnetic field generation.
  I also work on topics more broadly related to turbulence.
  This includes studies of primordial magnetic fields potentially generated by turbulent processes in the early universe.
  In addition, I am interested in turbulence in quantum fluids and have developed my own simulation code, Vernalis, for modeling trapped Bose–Einstein condensates.
